# Handoff Archive

This directory contains historical handoff documents.

Files are automatically archived when a new handoff is generated.

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-developer.md`

Example: `2026-01-14-1800-gaurav.md`

## Retention

Archive files can be pruned periodically. Recent handoffs (last 30 days) should be kept for reference.
