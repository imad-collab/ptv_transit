## Key Technical Decisions

### GTFS Data Extraction
- **What**: Extracted only V/Line regional train data (route_type=1)
- **Why**: Full extraction with all modes (metro, tram, bus) had performance issues on 17M rows
- **Result**: 497 stops, 13 routes, 8,096 trips - sufficient for development
- **Future**: May need to extract all modes for full Melbourne network

### Test Fixtures
- **Location**: `tests/test_data/fixtures/`
- **Files**: 8 CSV files (stops.txt, routes.txt, trips.txt, etc.)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with BOM (matches real GTFS files)
- **Size**: 2-4 sample records per file for fast testing

### Fuzzy Matching
- **Library**: fuzzywuzzy with python-Levenshtein
- **Scorer**: `token_sort_ratio` (handles word order)
- **Default threshold**: 60% similarity
- **Example**: "Waurn Pond" → "Waurn Ponds Station" (95% match)

- **Example route**: Geelong - Melbourne Via Geelong line
- **Example trip**: Departs Tarneit 14:57, arrives Waurn Ponds 15:48 (51 min)

### GTFS Data Stats
- 497 stops
- 13 routes
- 8,096 trips
- 1,989 trips serve both Tarneit and Waurn Ponds

## How to Resume Work

### Quick Context Refresh
1. **Read this file** (CONTEXT.md) - You're doing it now! ✅
2. **Check git status**: `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`
3. **Run tests**: `pytest` to verify everything works
4. **Review**: `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` for detailed progress

### Next Steps - Phase 6: Web API & CLI

**Goal**: Build RESTful API and command-line interface

**Tasks**:
1. Set up FastAPI application structure
2. Create API endpoints for journey queries
3. Implement JSON response formatting
4. Add input validation and error handling
5. Create command-line interface for queries
6. Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
7. Write comprehensive tests for API endpoints
8. Target: 95%+ test coverage
9. Commit and push to GitHub

**Success Criteria**:
- RESTful API responds to journey queries
- JSON format for responses
- CLI accepts user queries
- API documentation available
- All tests passing

```

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

1. **Limited to V/Line data**: Need to extract metro, tram, bus for full network
2. **No service calendar filtering**: All trips loaded regardless of which days they run
3. **No direction filtering**: Trips in both directions included in results
4. **Missing optional files**: Calendar and transfers files may not exist in all feeds

These are intentional simplifications for Phase 1. Will be addressed in future phases.

---

## Key Questions You Asked

1. **"Explain what you mean by a trip?"**
   - A trip = one vehicle's complete journey on a route at a specific time
   - Example: The 8:00 AM train from Geelong to Melbourne is one trip
   - The same route may have 100+ trips per day at different times

2. **"Is Phase 1 done?"**
   - Yes! ✅ 62 tests, 97% coverage, committed to Git

3. **"Is Phase 2 done?"**
   - No, not started yet. Phase 2 is next.

4. **"Did my progress commit on GitHub repository?"**
   - Yes! ✅ All pushed to https://github.com/imad-collab/ptv_transit

## Important Concepts

### GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)
- **Static GTFS**: CSV files with schedules (stops.txt, routes.txt, trips.txt, etc.)
- **Realtime GTFS**: Protobuf API with live delays and positions
- **Our data**: 242 MB ZIP from PTV Open Data Portal

### Data Models
- **Stop**: A station/stop with location (lat/lon)
- **Route**: A transit line (e.g., "Geelong - Melbourne")
- **Trip**: One vehicle journey on a route with specific times
- **StopTime**: Arrival/departure time at a specific stop for a trip

### Testing Philosophy
- **Target**: 95%+ coverage on all new code
- **Approach**: Test-driven development, write tests first
- **Fixtures**: Use minimal sample data for fast tests
- **Real data**: Separate fixtures for integration testing

---

## Project Vision

### End Goal
A journey planner that answers queries like:
- "How do I get from Tarneit to Waurn Ponds leaving at 2 PM?"
- "What's the fastest route from Flinders Street to Geelong?"
- "Show me all trains from Southern Cross in the next hour"

### Current Capability
- ✅ Can parse GTFS data
- ✅ Can find stations by name
- ✅ Can list all trips between two stations
- ✅ Can find optimal routes (Phase 3 complete!)
- ✅ Can track transport modes in journeys (Phase 4 complete!)
- ✅ Can apply real-time delays and cancellations (Phase 5 complete!)
- ❌ No web API or CLI yet (Phase 6)
